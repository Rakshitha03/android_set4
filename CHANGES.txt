Done with animation
Done with generating random numbers for cards and displaying for user

To do:

Everything works only for single player now. For multiplayer, major class shifting and creation may be necessary.
Game logic implementation - if using same methods, only methods to be called in proper places.
If not using same methods, then to rewrite :P
